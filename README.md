<h3 align="left">Rules</h3>

1. **Objective**: The game pits two players against each other, who must answer a series of quiz questions. The first player to advance their car to the finish line by correctly answering the questions wins the game.

2. **Advancing the Car**: Each correct answer moves the player's car a certain distance towards the finish line. Several questions may be required to reach the finish line.

3. **Incorrect Answers**: If a player answers a question incorrectly, their car may be slowed down or even moved back, depending on the game logic.

4. **Instant Loss**: If a player answers incorrectly to three questions, the other player wins immediately. This rule adds a strategic element to the game, requiring players to answer correctly to avoid defeat.

5. **Time Limit**: There may be a time limit to answer each question. If a player does not answer within the specified time, their car could be slowed down or moved back.

6. **Disconnection**: If a player disconnects during the game, the game may be paused until they reconnect, or they could lose the game.

7. **End of Game**: The game ends when one of the players reaches the finish line. The player who reaches the finish line first wins the game.
